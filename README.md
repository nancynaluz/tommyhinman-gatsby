This website uses Gatsby and React. I've adapted the readme from the default Gatsby readme, but there's not too much that's different from the default.


## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Check out this repository.**
    ```shell
    git clone [THIS REPO .git URL]
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd tommyhinman-gatsby/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`!

    _Note: You can also access Gatsby's graphql at_`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_.

    Open the `tommyhinman-gatsby` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`.

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that the project depends on (npm packages).

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser) such as the site header or a page template.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of the npm dependencies that were installed for the project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for the project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about the project. (You're reading it).

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## 💫 Deploy

This site is deployed using AWS Amplify. For tommyhinman.com it's connected through the Git repository directly, so there's no configuration in this package.
